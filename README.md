=======

Audio Abstraction library for interfacing with hardware audio I/O devices

Currently only supports Windows.
Currently only allows handles to be opened to available Audio Devices, passed around, but no buffer I/O. This will be coming shortly.

Expanded API and Documentation coming soon...
For auto-generated documentation, class-heirarchies, etc, see \html.

Currently the API is NOT STABLE. The API WILL CHANGE as needed, solidifying at a later date.
