AudioDX
=======

Audio Abstraction library for interfacing with hardware audio I/O devices

Currently only supports Windows.
API is about 80% implemented. There is now limited support for passing buffers to and fro. Currently, CaptureDevice buffer-getting is broken...

Expanded API and Documentation coming soon...
For auto-generated documentation, class-heirarchies, etc, see \html.

Currently the API is NOT STABLE. The API WILL CHANGE as needed, solidifying at a later date.
