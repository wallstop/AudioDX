Audio Abstraction library for interfacing with hardware audio I/\-O devices

Currently only supports Windows. Currently only allows handles to be opened to available Audio Devices, passed around, but no buffer I/\-O. This will be coming shortly.

Expanded A\-P\-I and Documentation coming soon... For auto-\/generated documentation, class-\/heirarchies, etc, see .

Currently the A\-P\-I is N\-O\-T S\-T\-A\-B\-L\-E. The A\-P\-I W\-I\-L\-L C\-H\-A\-N\-G\-E as needed, solidifying at a later date.
